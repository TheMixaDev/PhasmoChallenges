# PhasmoChallenges
__"PhasmoChallenges"__ is an alternative to tweaking Phasmophobia challenges through the "Challenge Wheel", but in the style of tarot cards and with improvements. In "PhasmoChallenges", each player is given individual challenges, as well as general challenges for difficulty modifiers and maps.
## How to use?
1. Select the number of players who are playing with you, as well as additional settings in the switches. 
> __Switches:__
> - __Discord:__ Using Discord in multiplayer mode, enables some challenges, which requires Discord
> - __Hardmode:__ An increased number of challenges per player, an additional 50% chance of one more challenge appearing in the card of the map, increased chances of higher standard difficulties
> - __No voice mods:__ Exclusion of cards on limits for communication.
2. After selecting the number of players, cards appear on the screen, each of which has hidden challenges for the player. Each player chooses which card he wants to take and the host opens this card by mouseclick. When you click on each card, an animation is played with the illumination of the card, depending on the number of challenges in it. After the animation, all players see the challenges received by the player.
> __Rarities and colors:__
> - __Common:__ White, 1 challenge, normal mode only
> - __Rare:__ Blue, 2 challenges
> - __Special:__ Pink, 3 challenges
> - __Legendary:__ Gold, 4 challenges
> - __Death:__ Red, 5 challenges, hardmode only
3. After all the players have seen their challenges, a card appears in which the Custom Game modifiers are indicated, as well as maps to choose from and the name of the difficulty. The glow of the card depends on the level of difficulty and the number of challenges.
4. After completing the game, refresh the page (F5) to get new challenges for the next game. Good luck!

## Probabilities
There is fixed probability for each card for amount of challenges. In normal mode each card can contain from 1 to 4 challenges.
Amount | Chance (in %)
--- | ---
1 challenge | 74.9%
2 challenges | 16.2%
3 challenges | 7.4%
4 challenges | 1.2%

In hardmode there is __ALWAYS__ one additional challenge for each card. So every card contains from 2 to 5 challenges.

Chances of every difficulty:
Difficulty | Chance (in %)
--- | ---
Professional | 65%
Nightmare | 31.5%
Insanity | 2.25%
Random | 2.25%

For map card, there are separate chances for every challange:
Modifier | Independent chance (in %)
--- | ---
1 challenge on professional | 90%
1 challenge on nightmare | 60%
1 challenge on insanity | 10%
"Double challenge" | 15%
Swap card | 5%
8-bit | 10%

Hardmode applies one more standart challenge with 50% chance, and increases probability for every challenge appearance with 1.2 - 2 multiplier. Also, hardmode tweaks difficulty chances in favor of Nightmare and Insanity.
